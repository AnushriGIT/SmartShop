description: Create a paired markdown reference doc + HTML Mermaid sequence-diagram artifact documenting an implementation/execution flow, for quick future reference. Use when asked to document "how X works", create a "sequence flow diagram", or produce a learning/reference doc for a pipeline, service, or feature that's been built or changed.

# Knowledge Artifact Doc

Produces the reference-material pattern this project settled on after several iterations: one markdown doc (brief, commands, tables — searchable, copy-pasteable) paired with one HTML artifact (Mermaid sequence diagram — faster to read visually than prose). Codifies the Mermaid rendering pitfalls this project hit and fixed, so they aren't re-discovered from scratch next time.

## Step 1 — Scope & location

If not already given, ask what implementation/flow to document and where the output should live. Default to a `Reference/Learning/<topic>/` folder if the project has one; otherwise check for an existing precedent folder before inventing a new location.

## Step 2 — One pair, not one per request

A single `<topic>-reference.md` + single `<topic>-sequence-flow.html` (or just `<topic>.html`/`.md` if it's the folder's only topic), covering the *current* state of the code. When re-documenting after a change, **update the existing pair in place** — edit the markdown, edit and republish the artifact — rather than creating a new dated/numbered file (`v2`, `02-...`). Numbered files accumulating over time is the exact anti-pattern that previously required a cleanup pass in this project.

## Step 3 — Markdown doc contents

Model on a working example if one exists in the repo already. Otherwise include, roughly in this order: one-paragraph brief, module/responsibility table, data model or key-entity quick reference, one-time environment setup, run commands (every mode the code supports), env var table, verification commands, troubleshooting table (symptom → cause → fix), links to related docs (specs, other reference docs). Skip sections that don't apply rather than leaving placeholders.

## Step 4 — HTML artifact: Mermaid mechanics

These are the specific bugs this project hit; avoid re-deriving them by trial and error.

- **Render natively**: `<pre class="mermaid">...</pre>`. Do **not** add `<div class="mermaid">` plus a manually loaded `mermaid.min.js` `<script>` — the artifact host already renders `<pre class="mermaid">` without any library load, and mixing in a manual one caused a real parsing bug here.
- **The native renderer parses raw, un-decoded text.** A literal `;` breaks parsing anywhere, including inside a `note`/label line — use `<br/>` for line breaks instead. HTML entities containing a semicolon (`&nbsp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`) break it too — write plain text instead (`run_id`, not `&lt;run_id&gt;`).
- **Set an explicit theme for contrast.** Mermaid's SVG output uses fixed colors from its theme, not `currentColor`, so the page's CSS cannot style diagram text or lines. Prepend every `sequenceDiagram` block with:
  ```
  %%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': {
    'primaryColor': '#dbeafe', 'primaryTextColor': '#0f172a', 'primaryBorderColor': '#1d4ed8',
    'lineColor': '#1e293b', 'actorBkg': '#dbeafe', 'actorBorderColor': '#1d4ed8', 'actorTextColor': '#0f172a',
    'actorLineColor': '#334155', 'signalColor': '#1e293b', 'signalTextColor': '#0f172a',
    'labelBoxBkgColor': '#fef3c7', 'labelBoxBorderColor': '#b45309', 'labelTextColor': '#0f172a',
    'loopTextColor': '#0f172a', 'noteBkgColor': '#fef9c3', 'noteTextColor': '#0f172a', 'noteBorderColor': '#a16207',
    'activationBorderColor': '#1d4ed8', 'activationBkgColor': '#dbeafe', 'sequenceNumberColor': '#0f172a'
  }}}%%
  ```
  (Dark text on light backgrounds. Swap the hex values if the page has its own palette, but keep the same high-contrast intent.)
- **Pin `pre.mermaid`'s background to a light color in both page themes** — `background: #f9f9f9` under plain `body` selectors *and* under `[data-theme="dark"]` (or the `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media query). The theme directive above assumes a light card behind the diagram; letting dark mode go near-black clashes with it.
- **Show real internal structure when it's part of what the reader needs.** If documenting an entry point whose internals matter (e.g. `main()` calling out to helper functions), draw those calls rather than collapsing the entry point into one opaque box.

## Step 5 — Verify before publishing (fast path by default)

Each `npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` invocation launches headless Chromium — it's the slowest step in this whole skill by a wide margin (roughly as long as everything else combined when it's called 3-4 times). Don't pay that cost more than once per diagram.

- **Always do**: extract every `sequenceDiagram` block (including its `%%{init}%%` line) to a temp `.mmd` file and render each to SVG in **one Bash call** covering all diagrams:
  ```bash
  npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i diagram1.mmd -o diagram1.svg
  npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli -i diagram2.mmd -o diagram2.svg
  ```
  A clean exit + a non-trivial `<text>` count (`grep -o "<text" diagram.svg | wc -l`) confirms the syntax parses and something real got drawn. This is the check that actually catches the semicolon/entity bugs below — keep it, every time.
- **Skip by default**: rendering to PNG and eyeballing it with `Read`. That step exists to catch bad contrast, and it's already solved — the `%%{init}%%` block in Step 4 is a known-good, copy-pasted constant at this point. Re-rendering PNGs to re-confirm a theme that hasn't changed is paying the slowest step in the skill for zero new information.
- **Only render PNGs when** you've changed a color in the theme block, or something about a specific diagram's layout looks suspicious from the SVG's text count alone (e.g. far fewer `<text>` elements than the source has labels).

This alone roughly halves the verification cost for the common case (2 SVG renders instead of 2 SVG + 2 PNG).

## Step 6 — Publish as a pair

Publish the HTML via the `Artifact` tool (a favicon is required only on first publish; republishing the same file path updates it in place). Cross-link the two files from each other's top — e.g. an "also available as" line in the markdown, and a "view the full command reference" link in the HTML.

## Step 7 — Update the folder's index

If the target folder has an `INDEX.md`/`README.md`, update its entry for this pair (or add one) rather than letting it drift out of sync — a stale index describing files that no longer exist, or missing ones that do, is exactly the kind of context rot this pattern exists to prevent.

This step and any cross-link edit into a governing spec (Step 6's "cross-link the two files" plus a pointer from the spec back to the learning folder) are independent writes to different files — fire them as parallel tool calls in one turn rather than one after another.
